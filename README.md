# DOMESTIQUE_BASTON
A free/open source Versus Fighting game...

DOMESTIQUE BASTON is a VERSUS FIGHTING GAME intended to be a casual one which means no complicated button combinations.
That being said, it'll involve combos and stuff like that nonetheless.

In order to limit the amount of work for that project, we found that the idea of a couple fighting would be an excellent reason for us to have only two playable characters (and we certainly don't care about political correctness).

It's scheduled to be released as a free/open source project by a French/Dutch team of good willing people! At this point of development, we still don't know under what kind of license it'll be distributed but for very sure a non commercial one.

Depending on the time and energy we have when "v1.0" will be released we'll eventually add features to that game but, and that's the point of the open source thing, don't wait for us and feel free to add whatever you want to that game. We'd be trilled to see what you'll be coming up with...
